The Valuation does not take into account any sale expenses, commissions and taxes (including capital taxes, duties, excises, value added or sales tax) which might apply or become due on a sale or transport of the object. Unless otherwise stated in writing, the Valuation is based upon a preliminary inspection of the photograph of the item submitted and without any physical inspection, cleaning, restoration, detailed inspection or disassembly and without any research into the item’s background or further tests and analysis. The Valuation is a statement of opinion and not fact.  3.2 The Company aims to provide the Valuation within [2] Business Days (Business Days for these purposes are the days on which banks are open for business in the United States of America) after the Client has submitted his request provided you have submitted all relevant details and information by [3]pm Pacific Standard Time (P.S.T.) or 2 Business Days from the following Business Day where all information has been submitted on or after 3pm PST on a Business Day or other day.

The Client shall indemnify and keep indemnified for 21 years the Company and its affiliated companies, and its and their servants, employees and officers against all liabilities and expenses incurred by them as a result of any breach of the above commitment by Client or arising from related claims by third parties in connection with the Valuation.   4.5 The Valuation may not be used for official or formal purposes such as (without limitation) in legal proceedings, insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings, divorces cases, for insurance purposes, or anything such like.   4.6 The Client shall have a perpetual non-transferable license to the Valuation subject to the Company’s right to revoke or withdraw its Valuation.

Particular circumstances affecting the value of an individual object may not be known or foreseeable at the time of the Valuation. Values can also fluctuate as a consequence of external circumstances such as (without limitation) changes in the prevailing market conditions for the object or changes in relevant scholarship. In addition, the preliminary nature of the valuation work carried out may mean that the identification, attribution and value of the object might be subject to change on further examination or research by experts at a later stage whether these are internal or external to the Company. Unless otherwise stated in writing, the Valuation only reflects an estimate, the inherent characteristics (visible from the photographs provided) of the object being valued and does not reflect the surrounding circumstances of the object being valued (such as, without limitation, the object's provenance or place in a wider collection, or the existence of several similar items available for sale at the same time).
