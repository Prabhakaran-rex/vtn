%h2 Web-site 
In general, you may browse our Internet site anonymously. However, when asked to value an item we require the collection of some personally identifying information, such as your name, address, and, when appropriate, your credit information. For transactions over the COLOSSES.COM web-site involving particularly confidential information, such as credit card numbers and accounting information, COLOSSES.COM will employ accepted transmission and storage protocols, such as encryption, to prevent this information from being disclosed. This means that when you type in sensitive information such as credit card details, it will be automatically converted into codes before being securely sent to us over the Internet. This information will be used for processing transactions but may also be used for internal data processing, such as compiling statistical information about your interests and the use of our Internet site. As a service to you, we may also use this information to customize the content we offer.  
%h2 Email 
In order to provide you with our valuation certificate and timely notice about upcoming offers and events, COLOSSES.COM may send you email notices. At the bottom of each email you will be provided with the option to opt out of such notifications by email. At any time, you may also send an email to info@colosses.com and request that your email address be removed from our lists.  
%h2 Business Relationships:
The COLOSSES.COM site may contain links to other Web sites. None of the information that you provide to us will be transmitted to other Web sites. COLOSSES.COM is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
