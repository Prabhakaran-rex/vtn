<h1>Determining Your Treasure's Value</h1>
</div>

<p>ValueMyTreasure.com makes use of professional personal property appraisers as well as subject matter experts who make use of their extensive experience, knowledge and research abilities to develop their opinions of replacement value (comparable) and fair market value. Values are provided in USD, but a link to an online currency converter is provided should you have the need.</p>
<p>Our appraiser take several factors into consideration when developing their opinions of value. Included are the item's rarity, the material from which it is made, quality of construction, age, provenance (history of past ownership), condition, its aesthetic appeal, whether or not the maker if well known of famous, etc. External factors such as the level of demand (or lack thereof) or trends/fads, or requlations prohibiting ownership or commercialization (such as those that affect ivory or trafficking in parts of endangered species of flora and fauna) may also impact on value. </p>
<p>Other factors might be taken into account as well depending on the nature of the item you are having appraised. For instance, often excessive size or weight can have a negative effect on value such as might be the case of too-large Oriental rugs or too-heavy player pianos!</p>
<p>Myluckytrasure.com appraisers provide two types of value: fair market value and replacement value (comparable).</p>
<p><em>Fair market value</em> reflects the amount of money most buyers pay and most sellers accept for a comparable property sold at retail, i.e., to the end consumer. It is the value level that is developed in the US to support a claimed tax return charitable deduction or to establish a value basis for estate tax purposes. Fair markt value is not a wholesale value. Technically, fair market value is defined as â€œThe price at which property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell and both having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts. The fair market value of a particular item of property is not to be determined by a forced sale price. In addition, the fair market value of an item of property must be determined by the sale price of comparable properties from within a market in which such items are &quot;most commonly&quot; sold to the public, i.e., the end consumer.</p>
<p><em>Replacement value (comparable)</em> is the worth of an item based on the amount of money necessary to obtain a comparable substitute property that would provide the same enjoyment, usefulness and other rights of ownership as did the subject property. Replacement value (comparable) is based on the substitute property's replacement cost (comparable) which is defined as the amount of money necessary to replace the item being appraised with a comparable item of property of like kind, age, quality, and utility having similar wear and tear, obsolescence, and value-relevant characteristics as the item being appraised. Replacement cost (comparable) is useful, for instance, when estimating replacement value (comparable) for acquiring insurance coverage of items not capable of being replaced with a brand new property such as antiques, collectibles, or works of art by a deceased artist. Replacement value appraisals make use of the retail market in which the client most customarily shops and in which he or she can obtain a replacement property within a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p>Online appraisals take into account the limiting condition that the appraiser did not personally inspect the property. That limiting condition may lead the appraiser to take &quot;extraordinary assumptions&quot; into account. <%= link_to 'Go here', :controller => :home, :action => :limiting %> to learn more about limiting conditions and extraordinary assumptions.<br />

ValueMyTreasure.com online appraisal reports are prepared in conformance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) as promulgated by The Appraisal Foundation of Washington DC.</p>
<p><strong>What is USPAP? </strong></p>
<p>USPAP are the generally accepted standards for all appraisers in the United States - be they real property appraisers, personal property appraisers, or business valuators. The purpose of USPAP is to promote and maintain a high level of public trust in appraisal practice by establishing requirements for appraisers. If properly understood and complied with, USPAP establishes a basis for credibility so that a report can be properly developed, meaningful, not misleading and worthy of belief. There is a high level of probability that a report has been developed competently and ethically if it has been written to the standards of USPAP.</p>
<p>USPAP was originally written in 1986-1987 by an appraisal profession Ad Hoc Committee and was donated to The Appraisal Foundation in 1987. The Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) of 1989 cites USPAP as the standard to be enforced by state real estate appraiser licensing and certification boards. In the Pension Protection Act of 2006 the Internal Revenue Service cites USPAP as a recommended standard to which all donation appraisals must be written. USPAP compliance is also required by professional appraisal associations, client groups and by dozens of federal, state and local agencies. USPAP is updated on a periodic basis, and is growing in acceptance throughout the world. Many professional associations in North America, South America, Europe and Asia have accepted USPAP as the standard of practice for their membership.</p>
