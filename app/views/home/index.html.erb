          You can learn a lot from an appraisal. For example, if you have an item to sell, an appraisel will 
          help you get the best price.Insurance companies may require appraisals for property insurance. 
          If you are moving, it's a good idea to get items appraised in case they are damaged during the move 
          and you need to file a damage claim.
          <br /><br />
          Appraisals are also very valuable for life events such as wills, inheritence and divorce. In addition to 
          learning about the market value of your item, you can also learn about it's history. Each piece has 
          a story to tell and and expert appraiser can reveal that story to you.They can also help you find groups 
          and other people that share your interest in the item. <a href="#"><%= link_to "Learn about your item with an online appraisal.", main_app.new_user_session_path %></a>
